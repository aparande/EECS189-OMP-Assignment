- **Due December 1, 11:59 PM**  Create a GitHub repository containing the following:
    - [ ] Documentation (slide-deck *and* a note for hypothetical students) both in **PDF form**
    - [ ] A fully working coding assignment/project for students to do, along with a complete solution and a detailed description of the learning objectives being achieved, together with a narrative of how those objectives are being achieved by this assignment
    - [ ] "Quiz questions” along with answers that could in principle be used to see if students have a passing-level understanding of their particular week’s learning objectives.
    - [ ] A README explaining how to navigate your repository.
    - [ ] **Submit the following [Google Form](https://forms.gle/heCg7zRmz8ZWePE26) containing the link to your GitHub repository. Save your Google Form response as a PDF and submit onto Gradescope.**
- **Code Review** You will be paired with two other teams to review and improve each other's work.
    - [ ] By **December 4, 11:59 PM**  You will be scheduled for 1.5-hour slots, paired with two other teams. You should review the other teams' projects and thoroughly running their code before this meeting. A part of your grade will be on how thoroughly you reviewed your peers' project. After the meeting, each team will be responsible for turning in a Google form discussing what was covered in the meeting:
        - [ ] What were good and bad parts about your peers' projects?
        - [ ] What were good and bad parts about your project?
        - [ ] Note: You will have to provide a thorough review about your work and others' work to get full points.
    - [ ] You should make fixes based on the comments you received by **December 10, 11:59 PM.**
    - [ ] By **December 11, 11:59 PM** You will be responsible for updating your GitHub and submitting a 1-page short summary of improvements you made to your assignments, and another page providing a second peer review of your opponents work. What improvements do you observe? Do you see anything else they could do to improve upon their work?

In addition to the above individual team deliverables, those involved in this project are expected to be involved in the larger conversation among the project teams as things get planned out. Overall, it should be a fun project that recognizes that there are diverse perspectives and skills that students in 189/289A bring to machine learning. The project generally emphasizes the programming and visualization side a bit more than the math side.
