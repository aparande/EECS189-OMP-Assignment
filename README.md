# EECS 189 - OMP For Linear Regression Educational Materials

This repository contains educational material for use in a hypothetical practical machine learning course. It covers Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and its use for outlier removal in machine learning. It assumes that the reader is a UC Berkeley student who has taken EECS 16A (Designing Information Devices and Systems I).

- The *Note* directory contains a PDF (and corresponding `.tex` file) of a theoretical explanation of OMP and outliers.
- The *Slides* directory contains a PDF (and corresponding `.pptx` file) of a slide deck that could be used in a lecture to teach OMP for outlier removal.
- The *Quiz* directory contains a Quiz with and without solutions in PDF form (and corresponding `.tex` files) which measures students' understanding of the concept.
- The *Jupyter Assignment* directory contains an assignment in the form of a Jupyter Notebook which students can fill out to use OMP in practice on real datasets. It contains the [UCI Forest Fire Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires) in CSV format as well as the Boston Housing Dataset.

## Learning Objective
After going through the materials in our repository, students should understand the theoretical underpinnings of OMP (primarily from their EECS 16A background) and how it situates itself in the context of Machine Learning. They will also understand out outliers can skew regression and why removing these outliers will fix the issue. Finally, students will understand how to program OMP and how to apply it to real data sets, including how to choose the correct number of outliers and other hyper-parameters for OMP.

*This repository was developed for EECS 189 (Introduction to Machine Learning) at Berkeley for a final project.*
